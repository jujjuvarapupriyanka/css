        <h1>my favrouite recepie biryani</h1>
        <p>is a mixed rice dish that is thought to have originated from Iran or South India.[1][2] It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables for the meat.[3] Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are added.[4]

Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[5] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India</p>
